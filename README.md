# Overview

I figured we live in 21st century, I wanted to write a program that makes life easier for someone and Python was honestly the way to do it.
The program starts by creating a list of names, ask if there are couples that cant draw each other and randomly assign names to each person for any Christmas or other purpose.
I added the option to save it to a txt file because a file is much easier to work with than taking a picture with your phone and then passing a photo around.

The reason I wrote this program is because my Mom doesn't want to write, cut and draw 20 names for Christmas each year now that everyone is living far away

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code, I'm not sure if Visual Studio (purple) is Python Friendly, but for a single file, VSC is easier.

This is a Python program and demonstration

# Future Work

* I want to find a way to not brute force through the name selecting. I originally had 2 lists and only one had the names be removed from but the list did not work like I expected   because it wasn't an array.
* One feature I thought would be nice that I realized AFTER was to set a price range and also save that to the file.
